Working on it ...

By now the best model for ETH seems to be Arima, but for other cryptos like Swipe that is more 
volatile and has less data the accuracy and predictions turns very bad 24/07/2020

By now the best model ARIMA (not tunned) failed because ETH variation near date 25/07/2020

Best model is arima tuned for XMR, ETH and BTC with data by day but there are some issues with dates.
